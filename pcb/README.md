# Printed Circuit Board


Inside this folder, you will find the Gerber files for the printed circuit board (PCB).
These files contain the necessary data for manufacturing the PCB, including the copper traces, drill holes, and component placements.

## How to Order PCB

To order the PCB, please visit [EasyEDA](https://docs.easyeda.com/en/PCB/Order-PCB), the platform we used for designing the PCB. EasyEDA allows you to upload
the Gerber files and provides options for customizing your order, such as choosing the PCB material, thickness, and quantity.

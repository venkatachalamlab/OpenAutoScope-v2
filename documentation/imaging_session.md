Here is an example flow for running an imaging session:

1- Begin by following the [sample preparation protocol](sample_preparation.md) to prepare your imaging sample.  
2- Open a command prompt and enter `activate oas && oas` to run the GUI.  
3- Select the directory where you want to save the data from the imaging session.  
4- Utilize the buttons on the graphical user interface (GUI) or the Xbox controller to locate and position the worm within the field of view.  
5- Choose the appropriate tracking model for your experiment. If using interpolation tracking, navigate to the marked points and set the points on the GUI accordingly.  
6- Confirm that the tracker is detecting the worm correctly (left displayer on the GUI).  
7- Start the tracking. The system will continuously update the tracked data as the imaging session progresses.  
8- Begin the recording of the imaging session to capture the data.

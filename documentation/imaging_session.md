Here is an example flow for running an imaging session:

1- Begin by following the [sample preparation protocol](sample_preparation.md) to prepare your imaging sample.  
2- Open a command prompt and enter `activate oas && oas` to run the GUI.  
3- Select the directory where you want to save the data from the imaging session.  
4- If you intend to employ the z interpolation method for tracking, simply mark the checkbox for 'z interpolation tracking' on the GUI. Then, locate three designated points on the agar surface and adjust the stage's position in the z direction to focus on each of these points. Once focused on a point, press the corresponding 'set point i' button on the GUI, where 'i' represents the index of the point.  
5- Utilize the buttons on the graphical user interface (GUI) or the Xbox controller to locate and position the worm within the field of view.  
6- Choose the appropriate x-y tracking model for your experiment. 
7- Confirm that the tracker is detecting the worm correctly (left displayer on the GUI).  
8- Start the tracking. The system will continuously update the tracked data as the imaging session progresses.  
9- Begin the recording of the imaging session to capture the data.
